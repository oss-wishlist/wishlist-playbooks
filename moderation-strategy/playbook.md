# Moderation Strategy

Modreation tends to be an afterthought, and often becomes urgent as the lack of a strategy takes hold: spam, AI slop, community chaos or just more nosie than one can process.   This playbook is intended to help maintainers co-build a strategy with their team and community to setup for success in the future.  

**NOTE**: moderation strategy can include code of conduct response, but the details of creating that document, and response times is a governance task.
