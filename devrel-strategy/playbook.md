# Developer Relations Strategy

Playbook for pracitioners and maintainers to work together on a strategy to grow developer adoption and/or contribution.

## Process Milestones

Note: that some milestones may not currently apply to a project (for example, there are no existing contributors to sponsor), but documentation for future consideration is encouraged.

1. Kick off meeting: Maintainer meets with OSS Wishlist admin and pracitioner (whether sponsor employee or verified pracitioner) to align on goals and timeline.
2. Audience Definition & Alignment
3. Communication & Outreach Strategy
4. Developer Experience & Pathways
5. Advocacy, Relationships & Ecosystem Growth
6. Feedback, Measurement & Renewal 
7. Wrap up meeting: Maintainer meets with OSS Wishlist maintainer and pracitioner
8. Survey (maintainer and pracitioner)

## Open Source Developer Relations (DevRel) – Peer Review Rubric

**Purpose:** Evaluate how well a project understands, reaches, and sustains the developer and collaborator audiences it depends on — including contributors, users, testers, advocates, and partners.  
This rubric measures strategic clarity, outreach readiness, trust, and feedback cycles.

**Scoring (per criterion):**  
0 = Absent | 1 = Minimal/ad-hoc | 2 = Partial or inconsistent | 3 = Strong, coordinated | 4 = Mature, data-informed, and self-sustaining
