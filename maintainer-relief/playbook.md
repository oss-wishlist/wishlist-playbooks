## Maintainer Relief – Peer Review Rubric

**Purpose:** Evaluate how effectively a project reduces unnecessary maintainer labor, prevents burnout, and maintains healthy contributor pathways.

**Scoring Scale per Criterion:**  
0 = Missing / No evidence  
1 = Minimal / Ad-hoc  
2 = Adequate but inconsistent  
3 = Strong systems and tooling in place  
4 = Excellent, continuously improved and proactive

| **A1. PR / Issue Response Expectations** | Clear SLAs or triage norms; auto-labeling; backlog managed intentionally. | 0–4 |
| **A2. Spam & Low-Quality Contribution Filtering** | Templates, validation checks, human-trained spam filters; maintainers shielded from junk. | 0–4 |
| **A3. Automation for Repetitive Tasks** | Bots perform merging checks, labeling, stale closing, release automation. | 0–4 |

### D. Operational Quality Hygiene (0–12 pts)

| **D1. Pre-Submission Quality Controls** | CI verifies linting, tests, docs build; required checks before any maintainer involvement. | 0–4 |
| **D2. Issue / PR Templates & Category Structure** | Forms enforce reproducibility and deter noise; bots close incomplete submissions. | 0–4 |
| **D3. Clear Prioritization & Deferral Rules** | Signals what maintainers *will* and *won’t* do; reduces emotional labour and boundary violations. | 0–4 |

### ✅ Total Score: **/ 48 pts**

| Rating | Descriptor |
|------:|------------|

| 24–35 | Adequate — Maintainers still overburdened in key areas |
| 12–23 | Weak — Maintainer burnout risk high, unsustainable workload |
| 0–11 | Not Viable — Maintainers carrying all burden with high distress |
