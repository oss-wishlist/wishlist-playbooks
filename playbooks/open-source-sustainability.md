## Success Rubric

| Criteria | Beginning | Developing | Proficient | Exemplary |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Community Engagement** | Irregular responses to issues/PRs, minimal community interaction | Some regular engagement, documentation exists but incomplete | Consistent engagement within 48 hours, comprehensive docs, active discussions | Vibrant community with multiple active contributors, mentorship programs, regular events |
| **Governance** | No documented governance, decisions made ad-hoc | Basic governance documented, some transparency in decisions | Clear governance model, documented processes, transparent decision-making | Mature governance with multiple maintainers, clear succession planning, community involvement in decisions |
| **Financial Health** | No funding, relying on volunteer time only | Some sporadic sponsorship or grants | Consistent funding covering core expenses, transparent budget | Diversified funding sources, financial reserves, paid maintainers, foundation backing |
| **Contributor Diversity** | Single or few contributors, no diversity efforts | Growing contributor base, basic diversity initiatives | Regular new contributors, active diversity and inclusion efforts | Highly diverse contributor base across dimensions, proven inclusive practices |
| **Documentation** | Minimal README only | Basic docs for users and contributors | Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, examples | Extensive documentation, videos, interactive tutorials, multiple languages |
| **Project Health** | Inactive or sporadic updates, many stale issues | Regular updates, some issue management | Consistent releases, active issue triage, clear roadmap | Healthy velocity, automated processes, predictable releases, strong ecosystem |

## Measurement Metrics

### Community Metrics
- **Contributors:** Track number of active contributors per month/quarter
- **Response Time:** Measure time to first response on issues and PRs
- **Community Size:** Monitor GitHub stars, forks, and watchers
- **Diversity:** Track contributor diversity across geography, organization, and demographics (where voluntarily shared)

### Health Metrics
- **Release Frequency:** Number of releases per year and consistency
- **Issue Resolution Rate:** Percentage of issues closed vs. opened
- **Dependency Updates:** Frequency of dependency maintenance
- **Security Response:** Time to address security vulnerabilities

### Financial Metrics
- **Funding Amount:** Total funding received annually
- **Funding Sources:** Number and diversity of funding sources
- **Runway:** Months of operation covered by current funding
- **Sustainability Index:** Ratio of revenue to essential expenses

### Engagement Metrics
- **PR Merge Rate:** Percentage of external PRs that get merged
- **Documentation Views:** Traffic to documentation sites
- **Event Participation:** Attendance at community calls/events
- **Survey Responses:** Community satisfaction scores

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Maintaining Momentum
**Symptoms:** Declining contributions, stale issues, inactive discussions
**Solutions:**
- Organize community events or sprints
- Highlight "good first issues" for newcomers
- Celebrate milestones and thank contributors
- Refresh documentation and roadmap

### Challenge: Contributor Burnout
**Symptoms:** Key maintainers stepping back, delayed responses, quality decline
**Solutions:**

**Solutions:**
- Clearly define project scope and goals
- Create a formal RFC process for major changes
- Learn to say no gracefully
- Document what's in-scope and out-of-scope

### Challenge: Low Diversity
