## Success Rubric

| Criteria | Beginning | Developing | Proficient | Exemplary |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Burnout Prevention** | No awareness or discussion of burnout | Some recognition, limited prevention measures | Clear burnout indicators monitored, proactive prevention | Comprehensive burnout prevention culture, early intervention, sustainable practices normalized |
| **Boundary Setting** | Expectations unclear, always-on culture | Some documented boundaries, inconsistent enforcement | Clear boundaries set and respected, realistic expectations | Strong boundary culture, modeled by leadership, community accountability |
| **Work Distribution** | Heavy reliance on few people, single points of failure | Some distribution, bus factor > 1 | Work well distributed, multiple owners for critical areas | Highly distributed ownership, mentorship pipeline, smooth transitions |
| **Break Culture** | Breaks discouraged or stigmatized | Breaks allowed but not encouraged | Breaks normalized and celebrated | Strong sabbatical culture, structured handoffs, celebration of rest |
| **Support Systems** | No mental health discussion or resources | Basic awareness, some resources listed | Mental health openly discussed, peer support available | Comprehensive support, professional resources, anti-stigma culture |
| **Sustainability** | Reactive firefighting, high stress | Some automation, periodic overload | Sustainable pace, good documentation, manageable load | Highly automated, excellent docs, comfortable pace, reserves for surges |

## Measurement Metrics

### Community Health Indicators
- **Response Time Variability:** Spikes may indicate overwork
- **Late Night/Weekend Activity:** Pattern of after-hours work
- **Commit Frequency:** Sustained high volume without breaks
- **Issue/PR Age:** Growing backlog may indicate capacity issues

### Individual Health Metrics
- **Vacation Days Taken:** Are people taking time off?
- **Communication Tone:** Sentiment analysis of messages
- **Participation Patterns:** Sudden changes in engagement
- **Self-Reported Wellness:** Survey data on burnout, stress

### Structural Health Metrics
- **Bus Factor:** Number of people who can handle critical tasks
- **Onboarding Time:** How long to get new maintainers up to speed
- **Automation Coverage:** Percentage of tasks automated
- **Documentation Completeness:** Coverage of common tasks and questions

### Support Metrics
- **Resource Awareness:** Community knowledge of support options
- **Support Utilization:** Usage of mental health resources
- **Peer Support Activity:** Engagement in support channels
- **Recovery Time:** Time from burnout to healthy participation

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: "Hero" Culture
**Symptoms:** Glorifying overwork, competition over contributions, shame for taking breaks
**Solutions:**
- Actively counter hero narratives in communications
- Celebrate sustainable contributions, not just volume
- Highlight people taking healthy breaks
- Set and model reasonable working hours
- Make heroics the exception, not the expectation

### Challenge: Volunteer Guilt
**Symptoms:** Contributors feeling obligated despite being volunteers, unable to say no
**Solutions:**
- Regularly remind that participation is voluntary
- Make it easy to reduce involvement or step back
- Thank people for contributions without pressure for more
- Create clear "off-ramp" options
- Normalize partial or sporadic participation

### Challenge: Fear of Project Stalling
**Symptoms:** Maintainers push through burnout to keep project alive
**Solutions:**
- Accept that slower progress is better than maintainer burnout
- Reduce scope or slow release cadence if needed
- Communicate honestly about capacity constraints
- Consider project hibernation if needed
- Focus on quality over quantity

### Challenge: Lack of Funding for Support
**Symptoms:** Can't afford professional mental health resources or paid maintainers
**Solutions:**
- Create free peer support structures
- Connect with organizations offering free resources
- Apply for grants specifically for maintainer wellness
- Share resources across projects
- Advocate for funding that includes wellness support

### Challenge: Stigma Around Mental Health
**Symptoms:** People hide struggles, don't use resources, feel ashamed
**Solutions:**
- Leaders openly discuss their own mental health
- Use inclusive, non-stigmatizing language
- Provide anonymous support options
- Educate community about mental health
- Celebrate people who prioritize their wellness
