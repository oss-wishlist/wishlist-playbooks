# General / Custom Services Playbook

Playbook for maintainers and practitioners to collaborate on project-specific work that falls outside the defined OSS Wishlist service categories.

This playbook exists to ensure that **important, real, and sometimes urgent work** can still be supported even when it does not map to an existing rubric or impact model.

OSS Wishlist intentionally does **not** define, score, or market impact for these services.  
Any impact definition or reporting belongs to the maintainer, practitioner, and any sponsoring party.

---

## When to Use This Playbook

Use this playbook when:
- a project need does not align with an existing service rubric,
- the work is concrete and accountable (not exploratory only),
- the engagement is specific to one project’s context,
- or the service may be new, uncommon, or one-off.

Examples include (non-exhaustive):
- direct engineering contributions
- documentation or migration work
- program or project management
- release coordination
- infrastructure or tooling setup
- audits, assessments, or research
- community operations or contributor support
- bespoke advisory or implementation work

## Process Milestones

> Note: Some milestones may not apply in all cases.  
> When skipped, document the reason for clarity and future reuse.

### 1. Kickoff & Alignment
Maintainer meets with OSS Wishlist admin and practitioner to:
- describe the requested work
- confirm scope and boundaries
- clarify access, authority, and constraints
- agree on expected deliverables

### 2. Work Definition
Maintainer and practitioner jointly document:
- what work will be done
- what is explicitly out of scope
- what completion looks like

Any success criteria or metrics are defined **by the parties involved**, not by OSS Wishlist.

### 3. Execution
Practitioner carries out the agreed work, which may include:
- contributions to repositories or infrastructure
- coordination across contributors or teams
- creation of documentation, processes, or artifacts

All work should respect the project’s governance and norms.

### 4. Check-Ins (Optional)
Lightweight check-ins may be used to:
- validate direction
- adjust scope
- surface blockers early

Cadence is agreed between maintainer and practitioner.

### 5. Delivery & Handoff
Practitioner delivers agreed outputs, such as:
- merged contributions
- documentation or guides
- reports, plans, or operational artifacts

Ownership and next steps are made explicit.

### 6. Wrap-Up
Maintainer, practitioner, and OSS Wishlist admin meet to:
- confirm completion
- note unresolved items
- determine whether follow-on work is needed

### 7. Reflection (Optional)
Maintainer and practitioner may provide brief qualitative feedback on:
- clarity of the engagement
- usefulness of outcomes
- lessons for future collaborations

This reflection is not scored.

## Documentation Expectations

At minimum, the engagement should leave behind:
- a description of the original request
- a record of deliverables produced
- references to where outputs live
- notes on decisions or assumptions that matter for continuity

Documentation supports maintainers and future contributors, not evaluation.

---

## Resources

Resources are engagement-specific and may include:
- project documentation
- prior issues or proposals
- external tools or standards
- practitioner experience

*Resources may be added during the engagement as needed.*

---

## Review Notes (Non-Scoring)

- Was the work clearly defined and delivered?
- Were the outputs usable by the project?
- Are there dependencies or follow-ups?
- Should this type of work be considered for a future service category?

---

## Important Notes

- This playbook is intentionally **impact-agnostic at the platform level**.
- Work performed here may be measurable, but OSS Wishlist does not standardize or promote those metrics.
- This category exists to ensure important project needs are not excluded by predefined service boundaries.

---

*Recurring custom services may later be proposed as rubric-based offerings, but are not required to be.*
