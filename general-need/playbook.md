# General / Custom Services Playbook

Playbook for maintainers and practitioners to collaborate on project-specific work that falls outside the defined OSS Wishlist service categories.

This playbook exists to ensure that **important, real, and sometimes urgent work** can still be supported even when it does not map to an existing rubric or impact model.

OSS Wishlist intentionally does **not** define, score, or market impact for these services.  
Any impact definition or reporting belongs to the maintainer, practitioner, and any sponsoring party.

## When to Use This Playbook

Use this playbook when:
- a project need does not align with an existing service rubric,
- the work is concrete and accountable (not exploratory only),
- the engagement is specific to one project’s context,

Examples include (non-exhaustive):
- direct engineering contributions
- documentation or migration work
- program or project management
- release coordination
- infrastructure or tooling setup
- audits, assessments, or research
- community operations or contributor support
- bespoke advisory or implementation work
