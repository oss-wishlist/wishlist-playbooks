# Project and Community Governance

Governance in the context of healthy open communities, simply means that the leadership of a project and the community understand and are aligned on important  aspects required for the project to operate effeciently, effectively and with the trust.  `Trust`  being the most important in ensuring long-term sustainability, trusted governance ensures that everyone understands:

- Who project decision makers are
- What roles of influence exist, and the process to ascend into such roles
- How, if possible, to influence decisions regardless of authority
- Processes for making decisions
  - Technology choices
  - Operational processes 
  - Funding and resource distribution
  - AI/Alignment

Ultimately, the goal of this playbook is to ensure that governance is public, and includes milestones for community input.

## Resources
In addition to their own, we recommen recommend pracitioners consult and leverage these resourecs on governance topics:

- [Minimal Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG) : Minimum Viable Governance allows you to start an (project/GitHub) organization and sub-projects with simple governance in place at the outset - including legal terms, licensing and trademark issues, and due process. Having this governance in place early helps avoid disputes among participants down the road.
- [Contribution Leadder (CNCF example)](https://glossary.cncf.io/contributor-ladder/): Contribution ladders are transparent ways in which a project can document pathways for contribution, which may or may not progress towards greater responsiblity.
- [Inclusive Leadership (CHAOSS metric)](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-inclusive-leadership/): Outlines the way in which a project can invite diverse participation, with examples and templates.
- [Project Code of Conduct (CHAOSS)](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-code-of-conduct-for-a-project/): Ensure that processes for reporting behaviors is clear, created with community input and trusted. 
- [Psychological Safety](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-psychological-safety/): A focus on trust in all the above.
  
## Open Source Governance  – Peer Review Rubric
At the end of the wish effort, we will review success according to this rubric.

**Scoring Scale (per criterion):**
- 0 = Missing / Not Evident
- 1 = Weak / Ambiguous
- 2 = Adequate but Limited
- 3 = Strong and Effective
- 4 = Excellent / Exemplary (Model Standard)
