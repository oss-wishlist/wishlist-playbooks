# Project and Community Governance

Governance in the context of healthy open communities, simply means that the leadership of a project and the community understand and are aligned on important  aspects required for the project to operate effeciently, effectively and with the trust.  `Trust`  being the most important in ensuring long-term sustainability, trusted governance ensures that everyone understands:

- Who project decision makers are
- What roles of influence exist, and the process to ascend into such roles
- How, if possible, to influence decisions regardless of authority
- Processes for making decisions
  - Technology choices
  - Operational processes 
  - Funding and resource distribution

Ultimately, the goal of this playbook is to ensure that governance is public, and includes milestones for community input.
