# Security Audit and Update

A playbook for maintainers and pracitioners, in addition to their own resources.

**Important Note**: due to the obvious risk associated with this topic, at this moment we are looking to engage security foundations around this type of service.  We haven't had time for this, but appreciate outreach from those involved in this space to propose a path forward to help maintainers in a way that ensures the security of the fullfillment.

## Open Source Security – Peer Review Rubric  
(Aligned with OpenSSF Scorecard + Repository Security Best Practices)

**Purpose:** Evaluate the security posture and resilience of an open source project’s repository, workflows, dependencies, and contributor access.

**Scoring Scale per Criterion:**  
0 = Missing / No evidence  
1 = Weak / Ad-hoc  
2 = Adequate but partial coverage  
3 = Strong security posture, minor gaps  
4 = Excellent, proactive, and automated controls

## A. Access & Identity Security (0–12 pts)

| Criterion | Indicators of Excellence | Score |
|---------|--------------------------|------|
| **A1. Maintainer Account Security** | All organization/repo owners enforce 2FA; periodic access reviews. | 0–4 |
| **A2. Least-Privilege Roles** | Maintainer/admin roles minimized; automation uses granular tokens. | 0–4 |
| **A3. Protected Branches & Review Rules** | Required code reviews, status checks, signing/verification enforced. | 0–4 |

---

## B. Dependency & Supply-Chain Protection (0–16 pts)

| Criterion | Indicators of Excellence | Score |
|---------|--------------------------|------|
| **B1. Automated Dependency Scanning** | Dependabot or equivalent; alerts triaged promptly. | 0–4 |
| **B2. Vulnerability Remediation** | Clear SLA for fixing security CVEs; tracked in issue/PR workflow. | 0–4 |
| **B3. Trusted Sources & Pinning** | Version pinning, checksum verification, no unexpected external pulls. | 0–4 |
| **B4. Integrity & Signing** | Use of Sigstore/GPG for releases and/or provenance artifacts (SLSA). | 0–4 |

---

## C. Code Quality & Security Testing (0–12 pts)

| Criterion | Indicators of Excellence | Score |
|---------|--------------------------|------|
| **C1. Static/Dynamic Analysis** | Code scanning (CodeQL etc.) enabled and findings resolved. | 0–4 |
| **C2. CI Build Isolation & Hardening** | Builds run in protected environments; secrets masked and minimal. | 0–4 |
| **C3. Test Coverage for Critical Components** | Automated tests include security-relevant logic; coverage monitored. | 0–4 |

---

## D. Secure Practices for Contributors (0–12 pts)

| Criterion | Indicators of Excellence | Score |
|---------|--------------------------|------|
| **D1. Security Policy (SECURITY.md)** | Clear disclosure process; expected mitigations; protected contacts. | 0–4 |
| **D2. Issue Reporting & Triage Workflow** | Responsible disclosure honored; security issues tagged and tracked. | 0–4 |
| **D3. Contributor Safety in CI/CD** | No secret leakage; PR security validation before merge. | 0–4 |

---

## E. Risk Management & Governance Integration (0–8 pts)

| Criterion | Indicators of Excellence | Score |
|---------|--------------------------|------|
| **E1. Third-Party Access Risk** | Token rotation; dependency audits; trusted artifact registries. | 0–4 |
| **E2. Operational Security Maturity** | Adoption of frameworks: OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA, OSSF Best Practices. | 0–4 |

---

## ✅ Total Score: **/ 60 pts**

| Rating | Descriptor |
|-------:|------------|
| 55–60 | Excellent – Secure automation and continuous security investment |
| 46–54 | Strong – Minor improvements needed |
| 34–45 | Adequate – Some material risks remain |
| 20–33 | Weak – Significant gaps in repository security |
| 0–19 | Not Viable – High security risk exposure |
