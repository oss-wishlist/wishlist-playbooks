# Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Practitioner Playbook

A playbook for maintainers and practitioners, in addition to their own resources.

> **This is not legal advice.** Nothing here, including the rubric and any
> completed assessment, is a legal opinion on whether the Cyber Resilience Act
> applies to a project or whether it complies. Whether a project is a
> manufacturer, an open source steward, or out of scope is a legal
> determination about that project's particular circumstances, and it has real
> consequences. Consult qualified legal counsel before making any compliance
> claim or regulatory submission. The same caveat appears in the OpenChain
> checklist this playbook draws on.

**Important note on scope**

This service produces a readiness assessment and an evidence record. It is not a
conformity assessment, an EU Declaration of Conformity, or a basis for CE
marking. Those follow the routes set out in the Regulation and, where required,
involve a notified body. No practitioner and no rubric can substitute for them.

There is no accreditation scheme for CRA consultants, so "validated by a CRA
authority" describes something no practitioner can hold. Look for demonstrable
experience with vulnerability handling, SBOM tooling and coordinated
disclosure, and for a practitioner who is explicit about where their work stops
and legal advice begins.


## Process Milestones

* Kick off meeting: Maintainer meets with OSS Wishlist admin and practitioner (whether sponsor employee or verified practitioner) to align on goals and timeline.
* Milestones finalized
* Milestone completed
* Wrap up meeting: Maintainer meets with OSS Wishlist maintainer and practitioner
* Completed rubric and evidence record, handed to the maintainer. This records readiness, not compliance, and makes no conformity claim.
* Survey (maintainer and practitioner)

## Does the CRA apply to this project?

Answer this before anything else, because it decides whether the rest is an
obligation or an exercise. The roles are defined in CRA Art. 3.

- **Manufacturer** (Art. 3(13)) places a product with digital elements on the EU
  market under its own name or trademark. Most upstream open source projects are
  not manufacturers.
- **OSS Steward** (Art. 3(14), Recitals 18-19, Art. 24) provides support on a
  sustained basis for the development of FOSS and ensures its viability, without
  being a manufacturer. Foundations and some funded projects land here. Art.
  24(1) requires a lightweight, documented cybersecurity policy.
- **Neither.** An unfunded project with no commercial activity is generally out
  of scope, and may still use this rubric to help the people downstream who are
  in scope.

Where the classification is not obvious, the OpenChain checklist (5.1.5) sets
out the commercial-activity test from Commission guidance C(2026) 5252:
charging for the software; charging for support beyond cost recovery;
monetising through a platform; collecting personal data beyond security or
compatibility purposes; **or accepting donations that exceed operational
costs**. Treat these as indicators. A borderline case needs legal review.

The last of those matters to anyone reading this playbook because they are
thinking about funding. A project that starts taking significant sponsorship can
move across this line, and the answer it gave a year ago may no longer hold.

## EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) – Open Source Readiness Rubric

**Purpose:**  
Assess whether an open source project has reached a security and documentation state that enables downstream compliance with the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

**Important framing:**  
This rubric evaluates *enablement*, not legal responsibility.  
Passing this rubric supports downstream manufacturers’ CRA obligations.

**Audience:** Peer reviewers

**Scoring Model:**
Each criterion is scored independently.

- 0 = Not present
- 1 = Present but insufficient
- 2 = Present and sufficient (meets CRA enablement needs)

Criteria marked **[critical]** gate the result on their own: a 0 on any of them
is a Fail whatever else scores. A downstream manufacturer depends on these
directly. A disclosure channel and an identifiable dependency list have to exist
upstream for their own work to stand on anything.

## A. Vulnerability Disclosure & Response

| Criterion | 0 – Not Present | 1 – Insufficient | 2 – Sufficient | Score |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------|
| **A1. Public Disclosure Process** *[critical]* | No disclosure guidance | Informal or unclear | Clear, documented process (e.g. SECURITY.md) | 0–2 |
| **A2. Private Reporting Channel** *[critical]* | No private channel | Exists but unreliable | Clear, monitored reporting path | 0–2 |
| **A3. Vulnerability Handling Practice** | No evidence of handling | Inconsistent response | Demonstrated acknowledgement and remediation | 0–2 |

| **F1. Security Context Documentation** | No guidance | Minimal notes | Clear security assumptions & limits | 0–2 |
| **F2. Regulatory Awareness Statement** | None | Vague mention | Explicit support for downstream CRA compliance (no liability claim) | 0–2 |
| **F3. Support and End-of-Life Signal** | Nothing stated | Informal or inconsistent | Supported versions and end-of-life stated somewhere public | 0–2 |
| **F4. Machine-Readable Advisories** | Advisories only in prose, or none | Published inconsistently | Advisories machine-readable (GHSA, OSV, CSAF or OpenVEX), so downstream tooling can match them to versions | 0–2 |

## If this project is a steward: Article 14 reporting

Only for projects that concluded they are an OSS Steward or a manufacturer.
Art. 14 sets a three-stage cascade to the CRA Single Reporting Platform once
there is an **actively exploited** vulnerability or a severe incident:

| Stage | Clock | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| Early warning | 24 hours from awareness | Coordinating CSIRT and ENISA, via the SRP |
| Full notification | 72 hours from awareness | SRP, with severity, affected versions, interim mitigations |
| Final report | 14 days from a fix being available | SRP. Severe incidents: one month from the 72-hour notification |

Three things maintainers get wrong about this:

- It applies to **actively exploited** vulnerabilities and severe incidents, not
  to every CVE.
- The SME exemption covers the **fine** for missing the 24-hour window. It does
  not remove the obligation to report.
- The clock starts at awareness, so there needs to be a record of when awareness
  began. Nobody reconstructs that afterwards.

Readiness here is unglamorous and mostly done in advance: a named person and a
named backup, EU Login access to the SRP, an offline worksheet for when the
platform is unavailable, and one rehearsal. OpenChain checklist 4.4 and 4.5
cover this in full.

##  Overall CRA Readiness Result

**Passing Condition:**
- No **[critical]** criterion scores 0, **and**
- All criteria score **2**, **or** at most **two** criteria score **1**, with **no 0s**

**Results:**
- **Pass** – Project enables downstream CRA compliance
- **Conditional** – Gaps require remediation before regulated use
- **Fail** – Project state blocks CRA-regulated adoption
